### Examples

```bash
# Start playing
skipboi play

# Pause playback
skipboi pause

# Skip to the next track
skipboi next

# Go to the previous track
skipboi previous

# Show current track information
skipboi current

# Toggle play/pause
skipboi toggle

# Enable shuffle
skipboi shuffle

# Disable shuffle
skipboi shuffle-off

# Enable repeat all
skipboi repeat

# Enable repeat one
skipboi repeat-one

# Disable repeat
skipboi repeat-off

# Show version
skipboi version

# Show help
skipboi help
```

### Track Information

The `current` command (and its aliases `now`, `nowplaying`, `info`) displays the currently playing track's information:

```bash
$ skipboi current
üéµ Now Playing:
   Title:  Song Title
   Artist: Artist Name
   Album:  Album Name
```

Additionally, track information is automatically displayed when using the `next` or `previous` commands. A brief delay (0.5 seconds) is applied after changing tracks to ensure Apple Music has updated its state, providing accurate track information:

```bash
$ skipboi next
‚è≠Ô∏è  Next track
üéµ Now Playing:
   Title:  Next Song Title
   Artist: Next Artist Name
   Album:  Next Album Name
```

## How It Works

`skipboi` uses AppleScript through Swift's `NSAppleScript` API to communicate with the Apple Music app. This provides native, reliable control without requiring any additional dependencies or frameworks.

The application sends simple AppleScript commands like:

```applescript
tell application "Music"
    play
end tell
```

## Version Information

`skipboi` includes intelligent version detection that works across different installation methods:

### Checking Your Version

```bash
# All of these commands show the version
skipboi version
skipboi -v
skipboi --version
```

Example output:

```bash
$ skipboi version
skipboi v1.1.1
```

### Version Embedding Process

The version is automatically embedded during the build process:

1. **Release builds** (GitHub Actions): Version is extracted from git tags and embedded during compilation
2. **Homebrew installations**: Version is set from the formula during `brew install`
3. **Local builds**: Version can be set using the `SKIPBOI_VERSION` environment variable
4. **Development builds**: Falls back to "unknown" when no version is provided

### Building with Version Information

To build a release binary with proper version information:

```bash
# Using the included build script (recommended)
./build-release.sh

# Manual build with current git tag
SKIPBOI_VERSION=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0) swift build -c release

# Manual build with custom version
SKIPBOI_VERSION=v1.2.0 swift build -c release
```

The `build-release.sh` script automatically:

- Extracts the current git tag
- Sets the `SKIPBOI_VERSION` environment variable
- Builds a release binary
- Tests the version command
- Provides installation instructions

## Development

### Project Structure

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Package.swift           # Swift Package Manager configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sources/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ skipboi/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ skipboi.swift  # Main application code

```

### Building for Development

```bash
# Build in debug mode
swift build

# Run directly
swift run skipboi help

# Build in release mode
swift build -c release
```

### Code Structure

The application is structured with:

- `MusicController` class: Handles AppleScript execution for Apple Music commands
- `Skipboi` main struct: Parses command-line arguments and executes appropriate commands
- Platform-specific compilation: Uses `#if os(macOS)` to ensure macOS-only functionality

### Adding New Commands

To add a new command:

1. Add the AppleScript command to the `Command` enum in `MusicController`
2. Add a new case in the `switch` statement in `main()`
3. Update the `showUsage()` function with the new command documentation

### For Maintainers

To create a new release, see [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) for the complete release process.

#### Release Process & Version Handling

The release process automatically handles version embedding:

1. **Tag Creation**: When a new tag (e.g., `v1.2.0`) is pushed to GitHub
2. **GitHub Actions**: The release workflow automatically:
   - Extracts the version from the git tag
   - Sets `SKIPBOI_VERSION` environment variable during build
   - Creates release binaries with embedded version information
   - Updates the Homebrew formula with version-aware build instructions
3. **Distribution**: All distribution methods (GitHub releases, Homebrew) will contain the correct version

This ensures that users installing via any method will see the correct version when running `skipboi version`.

## Troubleshooting

### Homebrew installation issues

If you encounter issues installing via Homebrew:

```bash
# Update Homebrew
brew update

# Verify the tap
brew tap-info IanKnighton/homebrew-tap

# Try reinstalling
brew reinstall skipboi
```

### Apple Music not responding

Make sure Apple Music is installed and you've granted the necessary permissions. macOS may prompt you to allow Terminal (or your terminal emulator) to control Music.

### Version shows "unknown"

If `skipboi version` shows "unknown", this can happen in development builds. To fix:

```bash
# For development, use the build script
./build-release.sh

# Or set the version manually
SKIPBOI_VERSION=v1.1.1 swift build -c release
```

If you installed via Homebrew and still see "unknown", try reinstalling:

```bash
brew reinstall skipboi
```

### Permission denied when installing

If you get a permission error when copying to `/usr/local/bin/`, make sure you're using `sudo` or have write permissions to that directory.

### Command not found

Make sure `/usr/local/bin` is in your PATH, or use the full path to the binary:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

If `/usr/local/bin` is not in your PATH, add it to your shell configuration file (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.):

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```
