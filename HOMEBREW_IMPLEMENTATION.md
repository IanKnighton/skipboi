# Homebrew Support Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the Homebrew support implementation for skipboi.

## Files Created

### 1. `Formula/skipboi.rb` - Homebrew Formula
The Homebrew formula that defines how to install skipboi. It includes:
- Package metadata (description, homepage, license)
- macOS Catalina minimum requirement
- Xcode 14.0+ build dependency
- Build instructions using Swift Package Manager
- Basic test to verify the help command works

### 2. `.github/workflows/release.yml` - GitHub Actions Release Workflow
An automated workflow that triggers on version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`) and:
- Builds the release binary on macOS
- Creates a GitHub Release with pre-built binaries
- Automatically updates the Homebrew formula with the correct version and SHA256

### 3. `Formula/README.md` - Tap Documentation
Documentation for users who want to understand the Homebrew tap installation process.

### 4. `RELEASE.md` - Release Process Documentation
Comprehensive guide for maintainers on how to create new releases, including:
- Prerequisites
- Step-by-step release process
- Version numbering guidelines
- Troubleshooting tips
- Manual formula update instructions (if automation fails)

## Files Modified

### 1. `README.md`
Updated the installation section to:
- Make Homebrew the recommended installation method
- Keep "Building from Source" as an alternative
- Add Homebrew troubleshooting section
- Add reference to RELEASE.md for maintainers

## How It Works

### User Installation Flow
1. User runs `brew tap IanKnighton/skipboi` to add the tap
2. User runs `brew install skipboi` to install
3. Homebrew downloads the source tarball from GitHub
4. Homebrew builds skipboi from source on the user's machine
5. Binary is installed to Homebrew's bin directory (typically `/opt/homebrew/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`)

### Release Flow
1. Maintainer creates and pushes a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
2. GitHub Actions workflow triggers automatically
3. Workflow builds the release binary
4. Workflow creates a GitHub Release with binaries and checksums
5. Second job downloads the source tarball and calculates SHA256
6. Workflow updates `Formula/skipboi.rb` with new version and SHA256
7. Changes are committed and pushed to the main branch
8. Users can now install/upgrade to the new version via Homebrew

## Testing Before First Release

Before creating the first official release (v1.0.0), you should:

1. **Test the workflow** by creating a test tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.0-test
   git push origin v0.1.0-test
   ```

2. **Verify the workflow runs** successfully in the Actions tab

3. **Test the formula locally** (on macOS):
   ```bash
   brew install --build-from-source Formula/skipboi.rb
   skipboi help
   ```

4. **Delete the test release** and tag if everything works

5. **Create the official v1.0.0 release**

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Brew configuration is added**
- Formula file created with proper dependencies and build instructions
- Tap structure follows Homebrew conventions

✅ **Documentation is updated**
- README.md updated with Homebrew installation as primary method
- RELEASE.md added with comprehensive release process
- Formula/README.md added for tap documentation
- Troubleshooting section added for Homebrew-specific issues

✅ **CI/CD changes for versioning**
- GitHub Actions workflow automatically handles releases
- Formula is automatically updated with correct version and SHA256
- Binary artifacts are attached to GitHub Releases
- Release notes include installation instructions

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Add version flag to skipboi**
   ```swift
   case "version", "-v", "--version":
       print("skipboi v1.0.0")
   ```

2. **Add bottles (pre-compiled binaries)** for faster installation
   - Currently, Homebrew builds from source on each installation
   - Bottles would provide pre-compiled binaries for different macOS versions

3. **Submit to homebrew-core**
   - Currently a custom tap (IanKnighton/skipboi)
   - Could submit to official homebrew-core for wider distribution
   - Requires meeting homebrew-core's strict guidelines

## Notes

- The formula builds from source on each user's machine (no bottles yet)
- Requires Xcode 14.0+ to build
- Only works on macOS Catalina (10.15) or later
- First release should be tagged as `v1.0.0` to initialize the formula
