# Homebrew Support Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the Homebrew support implementation for skipboi.

## Files Created

### 1. `.github/workflows/release.yml` - GitHub Actions Release Workflow
An automated workflow that triggers on version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`) and:
- Builds the release binary on macOS
- Creates a GitHub Release with pre-built binaries
- Clones the `IanKnighton/homebrew-tap` repository
- Automatically updates the Homebrew formula with the correct version and SHA256
- Pushes changes to the homebrew-tap repository using HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN

### 2. `FORMULA_LOCATION.md` - Formula Location Reference
Documentation explaining where the Homebrew formula is maintained and how it's updated.

### 3. `RELEASE.md` - Release Process Documentation
Comprehensive guide for maintainers on how to create new releases, including:
- Prerequisites
- Step-by-step release process
- Version numbering guidelines
- Troubleshooting tips
- Manual formula update instructions (if automation fails)

### 4. `HOMEBREW_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation Summary
Technical implementation details and summary (this document).

## Files Modified

### 1. `README.md`
Updated the installation section to:
- Make Homebrew the recommended installation method (using `IanKnighton/homebrew-tap`)
- Keep "Building from Source" as an alternative
- Add Homebrew troubleshooting section
- Add reference to RELEASE.md for maintainers

## How It Works

### User Installation Flow
1. User runs `brew tap IanKnighton/homebrew-tap` to add the tap
2. User runs `brew install skipboi` to install
3. **NEW**: Homebrew downloads pre-compiled bottle (binary) from GitHub releases (fast)
4. **FALLBACK**: If bottle unavailable, Homebrew downloads source and builds locally
5. Binary is installed to Homebrew's bin directory (typically `/opt/homebrew/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`)

### Release Flow
1. Maintainer creates and pushes a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
2. GitHub Actions workflow triggers automatically
3. Workflow builds the release binary with embedded version information
4. **NEW**: Workflow creates Homebrew bottles (pre-compiled binaries) for multiple macOS versions:
   - `arm64_sonoma` (Apple Silicon on macOS Sonoma)
   - `arm64_monterey` (Apple Silicon on macOS Monterey)  
   - `x86_64_sonoma` (Intel on macOS Sonoma)
5. **NEW**: Workflow calculates SHA256 hashes for all bottle files
6. Workflow creates a GitHub Release with binaries, bottles, and checksums
7. Second job downloads the source tarball and calculates SHA256
8. **UPDATED**: Workflow updates the formula in `IanKnighton/homebrew-tap` repository with bottle information
9. Changes are committed and pushed to the homebrew-tap repository
10. Users can now install/upgrade to the new version via Homebrew (using bottles for fast installation)
4. Workflow creates a GitHub Release with binaries and checksums
5. Second job downloads the source tarball and calculates SHA256

7. Changes are committed and pushed to the homebrew-tap repository
8. Users can now install/upgrade to the new version via Homebrew

## Testing Before First Release

Before creating the first official release (v1.0.0), you should:

1. **Test the workflow** by creating a test tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.0-test
   git push origin v0.1.0-test
   ```

2. **Verify the workflow runs** successfully in the Actions tab

3. **Test the formula locally** (on macOS):
   ```bash
   brew install --build-from-source Formula/skipboi.rb
   skipboi help
   ```

4. **Delete the test release** and tag if everything works

5. **Create the official v1.0.0 release**

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Brew configuration is added**
- Formula file created with proper dependencies and build instructions
- Will be pushed to existing `IanKnighton/homebrew-tap` repository
- Uses HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN secret for authentication

✅ **Bottles (pre-compiled binaries) added** ⭐ **NEW**
- GitHub Actions workflow creates bottles for multiple macOS versions
- Bottles uploaded as release artifacts with SHA256 verification
- Formula includes bottle block for fast installation without compilation
- Supports both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs

✅ **Documentation is updated**
- README.md updated with Homebrew installation as primary method
- RELEASE.md added with comprehensive release process
- Formula/README.md added for tap documentation
- Troubleshooting section added for Homebrew-specific issues

✅ **CI/CD changes for versioning**
- GitHub Actions workflow automatically handles releases
- Formula in homebrew-tap repo is automatically updated with correct version and SHA256
- Uses HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN secret to push to external repository
- Binary artifacts and bottles are attached to GitHub Releases
- Release notes include installation instructions

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Add bottles for more macOS versions** 
   - Currently supports Sonoma and Monterey
   - Could add support for Ventura, Big Sur if needed

2. **Submit to homebrew-core**
   - Currently a custom tap (IanKnighton/homebrew-tap)
   - Could submit to official homebrew-core for wider distribution
   - Requires meeting homebrew-core's strict guidelines

3. **Cross-platform support**
   - Currently macOS-only due to AppleScript dependency
   - Could explore AppleScript alternatives for other platforms

## Bottle Technical Details

### Bottle Structure
Bottles follow Homebrew's expected directory structure:
```
skipboi/
└── {version}/
    └── bin/
        └── skipboi
```

### Bottle Naming Convention
- `skipboi-{version}.arm64_sonoma.bottle.tar.gz` - Apple Silicon macOS Sonoma
- `skipboi-{version}.arm64_monterey.bottle.tar.gz` - Apple Silicon macOS Monterey  
- `skipboi-{version}.x86_64_sonoma.bottle.tar.gz` - Intel macOS Sonoma

### SHA256 Verification
Each bottle includes SHA256 hash in the formula for security:
```ruby
bottle do
  sha256 cellar: :any_skip_relocation, arm64_sonoma:   "abc123..."
  sha256 cellar: :any_skip_relocation, arm64_monterey: "def456..."
  sha256 cellar: :any_skip_relocation, x86_64_sonoma:  "ghi789..."
end
```

## Notes

- The formula is maintained in the separate `IanKnighton/homebrew-tap` repository
- The workflow uses the HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN secret to push to the external repository
- **NEW**: The formula includes bottles for fast installation without compilation
- **NEW**: Fallback to source build if bottles are unavailable or incompatible
- Requires Xcode 14.0+ to build (only needed if building from source)
- Only works on macOS Catalina (10.15) or later
- First release should be tagged as `v1.0.0` to initialize the formula
- **NEW**: Version information is embedded in both bottles and source builds
