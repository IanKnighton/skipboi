üéµ Now Playing:
   Title:  Song Title
   Artist: Artist Name
   Album:  Album Name
```

Additionally, track information is automatically displayed when using the `next` or `previous` commands. A brief delay (0.5 seconds) is applied after changing tracks to ensure Apple Music has updated its state, providing accurate track information:

```bash
$ skipboi next
‚è≠Ô∏è  Next track
üéµ Now Playing:
   Title:  Next Song Title
   Artist: Next Artist Name
   Album:  Next Album Name
```
